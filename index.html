                <h1>Background</h1>
                Thiis protests happend in Canada and it was against COVID-19 vaccine mandates and restrictions, called the "Freedom Convoy" (French: Convoi de la liberté) by organizers, it began in early 2022. The initial convoy movement was created to protest vaccine mandates for crossing the United States border, but later evolved into a protest about COVID-19 mandates in general. Beginning January 22, hundreds of vehicles formed convoys from several points and traversed Canadian provinces before converging on Ottawa on January 29, 2022, with a rally at Parliament Hill. The convoys were joined by thousands of pedestrian protesters. Several offshoot protests blockaded provincial capitals and border crossings with the United States. <br>

                    <h1>POLITICAL REALISM</h1>
                    Realists consider the principal actors in the international arena to be states, which are concerned with their own security, act in pursuit of their own national interests, and struggle for power. <br> Therefore, according to Political Realism, Canada should not let the organizers of the "Freedom Convoy" get what they wanted because that will not selve the interest of the state and may have led an increase in Covid-19 cases which in turn will further the economie shut down which inpacts the government interest.<br>
    
                    <h1 style="margin-top: 40px;">Criticisms</h1>
                    Some criticisms of political realism argue that the decisions the government officials of a country make are the decisions of the entire nation.
                    <h1 style="margin-top: 40px;">Reality</h1>
                    It's not because the state decide to do something that it means that all the citizens of that state agrees with it. The state is just tring to maintain its power and to not flinch infront of irealistic demands, Against rule which are there to protect peoples (mask mandates and others)
                    
                    <h1 style="margin-top: 40px;">Limits of the state</h1>

                    <h1 style="margin-top: 40px;"> Did the government abuse of their powers?</h1>
                    According to thomas hubs theory, the government did not abuse their power because what the did was for the good if the state.

                    In the discipline of international relations there <br> are contending general theories or theoretical <br> perspectives. Realism, also known as political <br> realism, is a view of international politics that <br> stresses its competitive and conflictual side. <br> It is usually contrasted with idealism or liberalism, <br> which tends to emphasize cooperation.<br>

                    <h1>Power - Authority</h1>
                    Power simply, it refers to the ability to control people’s actions. <br> 
                    Authority Refers to the right to control people’s actions.<br>
                    According to Eric Lui, power is the ability to make others do what you will like them to do.
    
                    <h1 style="margin-top: 40px;">Authority</h1>
                    In Canada the person who has authority is the state. This authority have been given to them by  the peoples, so in a way we the people have the authority in a way. This relationship create a balance between the state and the peoples because what the state do is because we the peoples gave them this power. So if the government decides to stop a protest, that is because we gave them that authority. <br>
                    But did the state had the authority to freeze peoples accounts?

                    <h1 style="margin-top: 40px;">Authority</h1>
                    Did the state of Canada had the authority to freeze donations? Yes since they where able to do it that means they had authority to do it. Actualy the government indirectly freeze the accounts. All what they did was to influence the private companies to do what they wanted. Influence is another form of power/authority. 
                    
                    <h1 style="margin-top: 40px;">who had power</h1>
                    Who had power the convoy or the government during the protest? during the protest the government power was limited because they where unable to control the protest peoples. But they quickly regain power through the emergency act. <br>
                    <br>
                    emergency act: The Emergencies Act (French: Loi sur les mesures d'urgence) is a statute passed by the Parliament of Canada in 1988 which authorizes the Government of Canada to take extraordinary temporary measures to respond to public welfare emergencies, public order emergencies, international emergencies and war emergencies.
    
                    <h1 style="margin-top: 40px;"> Emergency act</h1>
                    Did the government use the emergency act properly? yes! the emergency act is to be used in case of public order emergency or others like that which was what the government did in this case. They use the emergency act to put back order and regain power. Truckers where been disordered by blocking roads and causing noises.

                    <h1>War and terrorism</h1>
                    Terrorism are acts of violence designed to create terror among the members of a society. Others focus on the idea that terrorism is violence in pursuit of a political goal such as a more just government.<br>
                    <br>
                    The philosopher C.A J Coady 
Defines terrorsim as intentionally targeting innocent civilians, with deadly or severe violence to inflict fear on them. Usually to demonstrate their power against the government.
<br>
    
                    <h1 style="margin-top: 40px;">Problems</h1>
                    Most acts of terrorism lack a clear and specific goal and there is little hope that the violence will achieve its goal.
                    <h1 style="margin-top: 40px;">Terrorism</h1>
                    The problems of the "freedom convoy" was between them and the government. But Some of the things that they did that could be called an act of terrorism was the vandalism that was done on the tomb of the unknown soldier. This may be consider an act of terrorism because as we said terrorism can be an act of violence to create terror among members of the society and this act above is a good example of it.
                    
                    <h1 style="margin-top: 40px;">Kants human right</h1>
                    Immanuel Kant believed that every human being has a priceless worth that must be respected. He believed we should act for the sake of every person. Therfore, we have to protect everyone. Kant would argue that the protesters here did not act for the sake of everyone but only for their own sake by direspecting all the covid rules which was made to protect lives.
    
                    <h1 style="margin-top: 40px;">Kants human right</h1>
                     Further more, kant also said  not only do we have a duty to protect someone’s freedom, we must also help them achieve their goals. Does that means that the governemnt took some freedom from peoples by forcing them to stay in confinment and by adding other restrictions like that? and is that why they felt the need to protect their freedom by protesting? No! the government did not took any one freedom all what they did was add consequency of some choices that the peoples will make for example if truckers did not get vacinated, the concequence would have been that they would not be able to cross the border and this may have led them to loose their job. So, the government did not take any one freedom from them.
