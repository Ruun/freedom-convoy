                <h1>Background</h1>
                Thiis protests happend in Canada and it was against COVID-19 vaccine mandates and restrictions, called the "Freedom Convoy" (French: Convoi de la liberté) by organizers, it began in early 2022. The initial convoy movement was created to protest vaccine mandates for crossing the United States border, but later evolved into a protest about COVID-19 mandates in general. Beginning January 22, hundreds of vehicles formed convoys from several points and traversed Canadian provinces before converging on Ottawa on January 29, 2022, with a rally at Parliament Hill. The convoys were joined by thousands of pedestrian protesters. Several offshoot protests blockaded provincial capitals and border crossings with the United States. <br>

                    <h1>POLITICAL REALISM</h1>
                    The author of this theory, Thomas Hobbes, believes that countries themselves still live in the ‘state of nature’ and that each country prioritize their own self interest over their morals. Therefore, according to Political Realism, Canada should not let the organizers of the "Freedom Convoy" get what they wanted because that will not selve the interest of the state and may have led an increase in Covid-19 cases<br>
    
                    <h1 style="margin-top: 40px;">Criticisms</h1>
                    Some criticisms of political realism argue that the decisions the government officials of a country make are the decisions of the entire nation.
                    <h1 style="margin-top: 40px;">Reality</h1>
                    It's not because the state decide to do something that it means that all the citizens of that state agrees with it. The state is just tring to maintain its power and to not flinch infront of irealistic demands, Against rule which are there to protect peoples (mask mandates and others)
